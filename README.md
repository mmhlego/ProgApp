# ProgApp: A necessary app for programmers

This application is written so it can help programmers increase their productivity and reduce the projecct complexity.

It consists of many different and useful tools:
- Project Manager
- Useful Code manager
- Todo list
- SQL Viewer



## Project Manager
Imagine working on a cross-platrorm app with different outputs, like android or ios devices and etc.
Or you are working on 2-3 projects at the same time.
If you want to open all of the projects you are currently are working on, you have to for example open android studio ans select project or browse, or open vs code and open folder and browse project and etc.

Doing this proccess over and over reduces our productivity rate and increases complexity in our work. So i wrote this project to help programmers with this problem.

Using this tool, you can import or create new projects using the supported languages and search and open the desired project using the available editors on your pc.

## Useful Code Manager
Programmers often use some codes that have the same concept. for example, search and sort algorithms or dependencies and ...
Writing these codes each and every time takes time and reduces our producctivity. Using this tool, you can save useful codes with desired tags and description and have access to them.
You can copy the code with just one click and paste it inside your code.

## Todo list
One of the most useful tools in programming is task manager apps to keep track of different features or bugs and manage our time.
You can add your tasks and manage them using on of the 7 different labels:
- Not Important
- Important
- Critical
- Need Help
- Todo
- Doing
- Finished

Each label has its own color code.
You can also mark a task as finished or change the importance of a task.

## SQL Viewer
This tool is currently under developement. After this tool is finished, you can chack database status and manage list of databases and also view data or run scripts on online or offline databases.

#### Supported programming languages:
